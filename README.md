Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Introduction

Fake news refers to deliberately fabricated or misleading information presented as factual news. With the rise of social media and instant-sharing platforms, the spread of fake news has accelerated, leading to serious consequences such as:

Influencing public opinion

Affecting election outcomes

Causing social unrest

Preserving the integrity of information is crucial for informed decision-making. This project focuses on building a machine learning–based system that detects fake news, helping to maintain a reliable information ecosystem and safeguard news credibility.

🎯 Objectives

Identify Misinformation: Detect and distinguish fake news articles from genuine ones.

Enhance Information Credibility: Provide users with a reliable tool to verify authenticity.

Prevent False Information Spread: Reduce the influence of misleading or harmful news.

Real-Time Detection: Analyze articles and social media posts in real-time, curbing the rapid spread of misinformation.

🛠️ Methodology

The project follows a structured ML pipeline:

Data Collection – Gather news articles and datasets containing labeled fake/genuine news.

Data Pre-processing – Clean, tokenize, and normalize text data.

Feature Engineering – Extract linguistic, semantic, and stylistic features (TF-IDF, embeddings, etc.).

Model Selection – Explore traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) and deep learning models.

Training & Validation – Train models and evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Feature Importance Analysis – Identify key indicators of fake news.

User Feedback Loop – Improve the system over time with real-world data and feedback.

📊 Results

Developed a machine learning–based classifier for fake news detection.

Achieved strong accuracy and reliability in distinguishing fake vs. genuine news.

Demonstrated capability for real-time mitigation of misinformation.
